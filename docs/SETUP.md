# Setup

- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (minimum version: v1.3-rc1)
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

7-Zip is used to create the `*.pk3` Quake III archive. Kart Builder will automatically find your 7-Zip installation and use it when exporting. For best results, install 7-Zip to one of the following locations:

* `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe`
* `C:\Program Files(x86)\7-Zip\7z.exe`

Alternatively, make one of the following commands available in your system:

* `7z`
* `7za`

If 7-Zip is installed elsewhere and there is no `7z` or `7za` command in your console, add your 7-Zip installation folder to your PATH. Use [Windows Path Editor](https://rix0rrr.github.io/WindowsPathEditor/) on Windows or run `export PATH=$PATH:<your 7-zip directory>` on Linux.
